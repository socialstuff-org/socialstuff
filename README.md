# SocialStuff
SocialStuff tries to combine all common features of social media service into one,
whilst providing anonymity and cryptographic security to the best extend possible.

## Services
SocialStuff is a bundle of services, so it is not a monolythic application.
Each service is meant to represent a distinct functionality.

### Identity
The identity service provides authentication and authorization functionalities
for users who are registered at a certain SocialStuff deployment.
